Part 1
1. I chose to show the closest words to 'Texas', since I'm from there
These are:
Texas
Louisiana
California
Arizona
Georgia
Veracruz
Ontario
2010
2009
2006
2013
Maryland
2005
1964
2011
2012
2001
Denmark
2008
2007
The other states make sense, and I find it interesting that many are relatively similar states.
The years were more surprising, but make sense in retrospect - one can say something happened "in Texas" or "in 2010" fairly interchangeably.

2. Similarity means how similar the words that tend to appear a given word are. I used cosine similarity as a distance metric.
This is important because removes magnitude bias - with similarities like euclidian distance, two words may tend to show up in the same context,
but one is much more common than the other, which would make them dissimilar. This isn't what we want - a word's frequency shouldn't matter,
only its context. Since cosine similarity instead uses angle, it isn't sensitive to this.

3. For the most similar pairs, I got "Pozzobonelli" and "Stoppani", which are hilarious. They likely only appear once, and have the same word after them.
For least similar pairs, I got "rest" and some form of white space.*****FIX******
