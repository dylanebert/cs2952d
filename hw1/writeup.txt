Part 1
1. I chose to show the closest words to 'Texas', since I'm from there
These are:
Texas
Louisiana
California
Arizona
Georgia
Veracruz
Ontario
2010
2009
2006
2013
Maryland
2005
1964
2011
2012
2001
Denmark
2008
2007
The other states make sense, and I find it interesting that many are relatively similar states.
The years were more surprising, but make sense in retrospect - one can say something happened "in Texas" or "in 2010" fairly interchangeably.
